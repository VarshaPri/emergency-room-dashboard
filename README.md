# üè• Emergency Room Data Analytics Dashboard | Excel Project

## Project Overview
Developed an interactive Emergency Room Data Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to deliver timely, actionable healthcare insights. The dashboard streamlines hospital reporting, resource planning, and operational decision-making through real-time analytics and intuitive visualizations.
## My Role & Contribution
**End-to-End solution design**: Led data preparation, modeling, and dashboard creation‚Äîfrom raw data to executive-ready reports.

**Healthcare problem-solving**: Provided insights into patient flow, wait times, admissions, and departmental performance for hospital management.

**Hands-on Excel expertise**: Utilized advanced Excel features (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX, charts, and slicers) for seamless analytics.

## Key Deliverables


### Patient Volume Monitoring

Track the total number of patients attending the emergency room each month, supporting demand analysis and staffing.

### Wait Time Analysis

Calculate and visualize average wait times, highlighting operational efficiency and bottlenecks.

### Admission Status Breakdown

Present the proportion of admitted vs. non-admitted patients, offering a snapshot of hospital utilization.

### Demographic Insights

Analyze patient age group and gender distributions to guide targeted resource allocation.

### Departmental Referrals

Display referrals to key departments (e.g., General Practice, Orthopedics) and those not referred, supporting process optimization.

### Timeliness Metrics

Quantify and visualize the percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes, driving quality-of-care improvements.

### Interactive Dashboard

Engaging visuals and Excel slicers enable users to slice the data by month and drill down into any KPI for customized insights.

## How It Works
**Power Query**: Automates and streamlines extraction, cleansing, and transformation of hospital data.

**Power Pivot**: Builds data relationships and enhances calculations with DAX formulas.

**Pivot Tables**: Summarizes and aggregates key metrics for reporting.

**Excel Chart Tools/Slicers**: Crafts interactive dashboards for intuitive, user-driven exploration.
